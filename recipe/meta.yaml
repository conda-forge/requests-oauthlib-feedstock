    Requests-OAuthlib
    =========================================================

    This project provides first-class OAuth library support for [Requests](http://python-requests.org).

    The OAuth 1 workflow
    --------------------

    OAuth 1 can seem overly complicated and it sure has its quirks. Luckily,
    requests_oauthlib hides most of these and let you focus at the task at hand.

    Accessing protected resources using requests_oauthlib is as simple as:

        >>> from requests_oauthlib import OAuth1Session
        >>> twitter = OAuth1Session('client_key',
                                    client_secret='client_secret',
                                    resource_owner_key='resource_owner_key',
                                    resource_owner_secret='resource_owner_secret')
        >>> url = 'https://api.twitter.com/1/account/settings.json'
        >>> r = twitter.get(url)

    Before accessing resources you will need to obtain a few credentials from your
    provider (e.g. Twitter) and authorization from the user for whom you wish to
    retrieve resources for. You can read all about this in the full
    [OAuth 1 workflow guide on RTD](https://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth1_workflow.html)

    The OAuth 2 workflow
    --------------------

    OAuth 2 is generally simpler than OAuth 1 but comes in more flavours. The most
    common being the Authorization Code Grant, also known as the WebApplication
    flow.

    Fetching a protected resource after obtaining an access token can be extremely
    simple. However, before accessing resources you will need to obtain a few
    credentials from your provider (e.g. Google) and authorization from the user
    for whom you wish to retrieve resources for. You can read all about this in the
    full [OAuth 2 workflow guide on RTD](https://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2_workflow.html).
